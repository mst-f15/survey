WLAN stands for Wireless Local Area Network.
WLAN provides wireless network access by using high frequency radio waves.
The network often provides access to the internet.
The most used WLAN standard is the IEEE 802.11 standard\cite{ieee_wifi_standard}, also known as, WiFi.
WiFi mostly uses 2.4 GHz frequencies for radio waves\cite{ieee_wifi_standard}.


WiFi is used for indoor positioning because of its availability
\cite{indoor_maps_google_slides}\cite{improving_wifi_using_bluetooth}.
This is the only reason for using WiFi, because the other methods available, bluetooth and RFID, are more expensive to set up \cite{improving_wifi_using_bluetooth}.
