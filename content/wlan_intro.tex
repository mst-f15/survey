\subsubsection{WLAN}\label{wifi}
WLAN stands for Wireless Local Area Network.
WLAN provides wireless network access by using high frequency radio waves.
The network often provides access to the internet.
The most used WLAN standard is the IEEE 802.11 standard\cite{ieee_wifi_standard}, also known as, WiFi.
WiFi mostly uses 2.4 GHz frequencies for radio waves\cite{ieee_wifi_standard}.


WiFi is ideal for indoor positioning because of its availability
\cite{indoor_maps_google_slides}\cite{improving_wifi_using_bluetooth}.
This is the primary reason for using WiFi, because the other methods available, bluetooth and RFID, are more accurate but they are more expensive to set up \cite{improving_wifi_using_bluetooth}.

\paragraph{Limitations}
When measuring signal strength to WiFi receivers there is the following noise:
 \begin{itemize}
 	\item Interference by other devices using the 2,4 GHz frequency - cordless phones, bluetooth devices etc.
 	\item The 2,4 GHz frequency is a resonant frequency of water - this means as humans mostly consist of water - so that they interfere with the signal as well.
\end{itemize}
 
Another challenge to take into account is the power usage.
A WiFi interface  of a mobile phones consumes 5 times as much power of what bluetooth devices use\cite{bluetooth_basics}.
