In this section, a brief overview of the currently available commercial solutions in regards to indoor mapping and localization will be presented, without going into the inner workings.

Google Maps Indoor already provides a publicly available method of making indoor maps (adding them to Google Maps), by uploading and fitting a schema on top of Google Maps \cite{google_maps_indoor}.
Additionally, Cartographer was recently introduced; a backpack with sensor equipment using SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) to continuously map while moving through a venue \cite{cartographer}.
The method for localization is a fused one, using sensors, GPS, wifi, and selected level \cite[Slide 45]{indoor_maps_google_slides}.

Micello, similar to Google, accepts floor plans to generate venue maps \cite{micello}.
Micello provides navigation within a venue, however, it does not provide any method of localization, while it is compatible with several localization providers.
