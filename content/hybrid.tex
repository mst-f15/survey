\subsubsection{Hybrid}
With WiFi being so inaccurate and being so sensitive to noise, see section \ref{wifi}.
Some studies have suggested doing indoor mapping by merging technologies such as WiFi and bluetooth \cite{hybrid_wifi_bluetooth} \cite{fusion_wifi_bluetooth}.

The hybrid model suggested by \citet{hybrid_wifi_bluetooth} uses WiFi and bluetooth.
It argues that because the availability of WiFi is very high and the cost of deploying bluetooth devices in a large area, a hybrid model is the best solution in most cases for improving the accuracy.


The model uses the fingerprinting technique mentioned in \cref{fingerprint} \todo[inline]{fix ref n√•r fingerprint bliver committed} on the WiFi and the room splitting technique mentioned in \cref{rooms} for bluetooth devices.
The roomsplitting reduces the computations needed to estimate the position by the fingerprinting technique, by making the radio map smaller.
