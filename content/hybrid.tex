\subsubsection{Hybrid}
With WiFi being so inaccurate and being so sensitive to noise, see section \ref{wifi}.
Some studies have suggested doing indoor mapping by merging technologies such as WiFi and bluetooth \cite{hybrid_wifi_bluetooth} \cite{fusion_wifi_bluetooth}.

The hybrid model suggested by \citet{hybrid_wifi_bluetooth} uses WiFi and bluetooth.
It argues that because of the availability of WiFi and the cost of deploying bluetooth devices in a large area are very high, a hybrid model is the best solution in most cases for improving the accuracy.

The model uses the fingerprinting technique mentioned in \cref{fingerprinting} for WiFi and the room splitting technique mentioned in \cref{rooms} for bluetooth devices.
The room splitting technique can be used on both bluetooth and RFID.
Using room splitting reduces the computations needed to estimate the position by the fingerprinting technique, by reducing the size of the radio map.
