\section{RFID}
RFID technology provides a way to tag items by means of a cheap tag that can then later be read with a RFID reader.

\subsection{What is RFID?}
\subsubsection{RFID tags} 
A RFID tag is a small object often in the form of a sticker, that can hold data and sends it to a reader upon request.
A tag contains a microchip containing the data and an antenna for communication with a reader.
Tags come in different variants regarding power source.
There exists both passive and active RFID tags.\cite{rfidreview}

The passive tags have no power source, and therefore relies on electromagnetic energy from the reader.
This limits the abilities of the tag to only containing a small amount of information, but they are very cheap.
Also the range of these tags are limited. \cite{rfidreview}

Active tags one the other hand have an internal battery.
This enables longer read ranges, onboard memory and even processing capacities.
The battery shortens the lifespan of the tag which is typically between 5 and 10 years and they are more expensive than the passive counterpart. \cite{rfidreview}

\subsubsection{RFID Readers}
The RFID reader contains a transceiver (a device with both a receiver and a transmitter) and an antenna.
The task of the reader is to read and write data to RFID tags.
Collected data is transferred to a computer when the data is received from the tag.\cite{rfidreview}
