This section is based on \citet{geomagnetism} where a positioning system using magnetic fields is presented.

Each building has a unique indoor magnetic field, made unique by the construction (concrete, steel beams etc.) of each building.
Each individual location within a building will be affected by the aforementioned parameters and will therefore have a unique signature, depending on how the magnetic field is at that exact location.

Using an electric compass as sensor the fingerprinting technique (see \cref{fingerprinting}) is used to make positioning possible.
