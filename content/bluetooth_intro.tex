The following is based on \citet{ieee_bluetooth_standard}.
Bluetooth is a low power consumption communications technology, intended for short-distance data exchange.
It is typically used to connect equipment to a device that is naturally close in proximity.
An example of this relation could be connecting a mouse or a keyboard to a computer or a mobile device.
Bluetooth is also used for handsfree headsets, for both mobile phones and landlines.
Such connectivity allows for both the transfer of audio as well as commands to the controlling unit.
This allows the headset perform things such as accepting and ending calls.

The \textit{''range''} of a Bluetooth device depends on its power consumption.
Because of this, devices are available with varying ranges.
