\section{Conclusion}
We have in this paper focused on indoor mapping, where we have studied different solutions.
There are multiple solutions using different technologies: WLAN, Bluetooth and RFID and methods: Triangulation, Proximity analysis, Fingerprinting and Hybrid.

The different radio-based technologies and localization methods are prone to errors doe to changing environment and obstetrical as well as availability and cost.
Technologies such as WLAN are widely common thus easily available to use for indoor mapping while Bluetooth and RFID are on the other hand not common available thus they are costly to implement.
The triangulation, proximity analysis and fingerprinting are different methods that uses mapping and reference points to estimate the position of the object.
Each building has a unique indoor magnetic field which can be used for fingerprinting, where a radio map is created with the different signal strengths at different locations.
