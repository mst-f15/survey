% Spending more time indoors
% GPS insufficient
% Current map making methods
% Current, closed, localization/navigation solutions

People spend most of the time indoors, yet the most well-versed mapping is only usable outside.
This includes both creation of maps and localization/navigation.

Google Project Ground Truth\cite{googleio_ground_truth} already cover most of the outdoors, and are now focusing on moving indoors \cite{googleio_indoor_maps}\cite{indoor_maps_google_slides}.
Methods of creating the maps include uploading and fitting of custom floor plans on top of Google Maps.
Another method, recently announced by Google, is the usage of a sensor-backpack using SLAM, called Cartographer \cite{cartographer}.
Other mention-worthy public solutions that are also available for creating indoor maps are Bing Maps\cite{bingmaps} and Micello\cite{micello}.

What is missing now, is proper indoor localization, to use for tracking and navigation.
GPS is both effective and efficient outdoors, however, it is near unusable in the indoors, as both availability and precision are not suited for indoor usage.
