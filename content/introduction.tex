People spend most of the time indoors, yet the most well-versed mapping is only usable outside.
This includes both creation of maps and localization/navigation.

Google Project Ground Truth\cite{googleio_ground_truth} already cover most of the outdoors, and are now focusing on moving indoors \cite{googleio_indoor_maps}\cite{indoor_maps_google_slides}.
Methods of creating the maps include uploading and fitting of custom floor plans on top of Google Maps.
Another method, recently announced by Google, is the usage of a sensor-backpack using SLAM, called Cartographer \cite{cartographer}.
Other mention-worthy public solutions that are also available for creating indoor maps are Bing Maps\cite{bingmaps} and Micello\cite{micello}.

What is missing now, is proper indoor localization, to use for tracking and navigation.
GPS is both effective and efficient outdoors, however, it is near unusable in the indoors, as both availability and precision are not suited for indoor usage.

There are several public and commercial solutions with regards to indoor localization, however, the inner workings of these are not available.
These solutions include Google Indoor Maps, which uses a fusion of WiFi RSS and mobile sensors, obtaining 7 meter accuracy \cite{googleio_indoor_maps}.
Connexient is a professional solution, which uses a fusion of BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) beacons in combination with WiFi RSS, mobile compass and accelerometer readings, claiming accuracy of 1-2 meters \cite{connexient_indoor_pos}.
Nextome is another professional solution, which uses iBeacons\cite{ibeacon}, claiming a 0.5 meter accuracy without the use of any net-based services, but only \textit{''[...]The innovative algorithm of NEXTOME uses advanced techniques of artificial intelligence to receive, categorize and analyze signals and identify the userâ€™s position in the room.[...]''} \cite{nextome_indoor_pos}.

As mentioned, all these solutions are very secretive, and the actual inner workings and algorithms are not known.
Therefore the current general solutions will be looked into.
