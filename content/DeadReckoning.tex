\section{Dead Reckoning}
Dead reckoning (DR) \cite{DR} is a navigation technique to estimate the positioning of a moving object for when signals of other technologies, like WiFi and bluetooth, are too weak to be read or blocked.
DR makes use of previously known positions to predict an estimated positioning of the object after a given time.
The known positions can be used to estimate the direction and velocity of the object over elapsed time if they are not already known.
Using the data it is possible to compute a displacement from the last known position after the time has passed.
The estimated displacement of the object is easily influenced by sources of error as the object might have changed direction or stopped moving.
This may result in a wrong estimate which may drift over time.

Data used for DR can be obtained from internal sensors that the object is carrying or external sensors which is observing the object.
An example which include both internal and external sensors could be smartphones.
Smartphones can be self-contained using built-in components such as gyroscope, accelerometer and compass.
They might also use the built-in GPS to communicate with satellites which provides the smartphones with external data.
